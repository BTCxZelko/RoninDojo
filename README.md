# Welcome to Ronin Dojo!

Ronin Dojo is the RPi4 and Odroid N2 installation variant of Samourai Wallet's Dojo. This is not a change to their code or application, rather the installation process modified specifically for RPi4/Odroid. 

Ronin should help regular users get a Dojo running farily quickly and easily. Our Mission is to bring full on-chain self-sovereignity at an afforable price.

“I dreamt of worldly success once.”

> Miyamoto Musashi, also known as Shinmen Takezō, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Dōraku, was a Japanese swordsman, philosopher, strategist, writer and rōnin. Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 61 duels.

“It is said the warrior's is the twofold Way of pen and sword, and he should have a taste for both Ways. Even if a man has no natural ability he can be a warrior by sticking assiduously to both divisions of the Way.”

> A Ronin was a samurai warrior in feudal Japan without a master or lord — known as a daimyo. A samurai could become a ronin in several different ways: his master might die or fall from power or the samurai might lose his master's favor or patronage and be cast off.

“Know your enemy, know his sword.”

Be Your own master!

# What is Samourai Dojo?
As stated by the Samourai Team:
>Samourai Dojo is the backing server for Samourai Wallet. Provides HD account & loose addresses (BIP47) balances & transactions lists. Provides unspent output lists to the wallet. PushTX endpoint broadcasts transactions through the backing bitcoind node.

This implementation connects to your wallet via Tor for increased privacy and allowing for connectivity anywhere without forwarding ports and exposing your home IP address.
